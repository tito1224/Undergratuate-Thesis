Test simulation with multiple runs, and only alpha changing (for now) (how do i stop the text file from showing??)
```{r, results = "hide"}
dfSimulation1 = calculateStatistics(nRuns = 2, lstNi = c(20), lstP = c(0.2), lstAlpha = c(0,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3), seed=1)
```


```{r}
dfSimulationEst = dfSimulation1[[1]]
dfSimulationParams= dfSimulation1[[2]]%>%
  filter(variable == "N")
```

```{r}
dfSimulationEst
dfSimulationParams
```
